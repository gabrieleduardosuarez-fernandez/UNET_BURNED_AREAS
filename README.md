# UNET_BURNED_AREAS

Scripts developed to train and test a CNN based on U-NET. 

Firstly, a script is developed in R to create a tailored dataset with each burned area image of 256px X 256px size. The burned areas were obtained from a previous process to create a real forest fire dataset. 

The U-NET was then trained with the python script. 

Model results will be shared upon request to the corresponding author.
